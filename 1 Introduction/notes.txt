1.  What is HTML?
    -> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
    -> It is the standard language for creating web pages.
    -> It describes the structure of a webpage using different elements (called tags).

    Structure of an HTML Document:
    Every HTML file follows this basic structure:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
          <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <!-- Content goes here -->
          </body>
        </html>

    Explanation:
    <!DOCTYPE html> → Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
    <html> → The root element, wraps the whole page.
    <head> → Contains information about the page (metadata, title, styles, etc.).
    <title> → The text shown in the browser tab.
    <body> → Contains the visible content of the webpage (text, images, links, etc.).

2.  Headings
    Headings are used for titles and subtitles.
    They go from <h1> (largest) to <h6> (smallest).
    Ex:
    <h1>Main Title</h1>
    <h2>Subtitle</h2>
    <h3>Smaller heading</h3>

3.  Paragraphs
    Paragraphs are written using the <p> tag.
    Browsers automatically add space before and after each paragraph.
    EX:
    <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>

4.  Line Breaks & Horizontal Lines
    <br> → Inserts a line break (moves text to next line).
    <hr> → Inserts a horizontal line (used to separate content).
    Ex:
    <p>Hello<br>This is on a new line.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Text after the line.</p>

->  Summary:
    HTML is the building block of web pages.
    It uses tags to define content.
    Basic structure = doctype → html → head → body.
    Common tags in basics: <h1>–<h6>, <p>, <br>, <hr>.
