Semantic Tags

    What are Semantic Tags?

    Semantic tags clearly describe the meaning of the content inside them.
    They help browsers, search engines, and developers understand the structure of a webpage.
    Example: <header> means "page header", <footer> means "page footer".

    Why Use Semantic Tags?
    
    Improves readability of code.
    Better for SEO (search engines can understand the content).
    Helps screen readers (accessibility for blind users).
    Makes page structure organized and maintainable.
